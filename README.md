## Description

This is a personal E-commerce App, built using HTML and CSS, Javascript, contentful, and netlify. 

This is an online shopping app where users can view existing products with no need to sign up or log in. To add items in the app, I have used `contentful`. To learn more about contentful, click [here](https://app.contentful.com/). Any user can select any of the existing products and buy them. This app does not contain any stripe feature.
